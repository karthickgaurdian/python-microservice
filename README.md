🚀 Getting Started
🔹 1. Clone the Repository

**git clone https://github.com/your-username/webhook-service.git**
cd webhook-service

🔹 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

**python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt**

🔹 3. Run the Webhook Service

**uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --reload**
Your webhook is now running at http://localhost:8000/webhook.

--------📡 Webhook Endpoint---------
➤ Receive Data (POST)

POST /webhook
Content-Type: application/json

📩 Example Request
{
    "event": "order_placed",
    "order_id": "12345"
}

✅ Example Response
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Data received"
}

---------🐳 (Optional) Run with Docker------
If your environment supports Docker:
docker build -t webhook-service .
docker run -p 8888:8888 webhook-service


---------🛠 Best Practices Followed---------
✅ Separation of Concerns – Routes, services, and config are modular
✅ Logging & Error Handling – Ensures visibility into webhook events
✅ Environment Variables – Configurations stored in config.py
✅ Security Considerations – Input validation and safe request handling
